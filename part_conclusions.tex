\frametitle{Conclusions}%
\begin{itemize}%
\item I have presented an initial version of the evaluator GUI component of the \optimizationBenchmarking\ framework%
\item<2-> It can already load and evaluate performance data from \emph{your} optimization or Machine Learning algorithm%
\item<3-> It can help \emph{you} to understand what the strengths and weaknesses of \emph{your} algorithm are%
\item<4-> It produces figures ready for use in \emph{your} publication%
\item<5-> {\dots}and these figures are optimized (size, fonts) for the journal or conference \emph{you} want to submit to.%  
\end{itemize}%

\frametitle{Future Work}%
\begin{itemize}%
\item We will add more evaluation modules, to reach the power of \tspSuite\expandafter\scitep{\tspSuiteReferences}, e.g., add automated algorithm ranking%
\item<2-> We will publicize the use of \optimizationBenchmarking\ to our colleagues, e.g., for use in competitions%
\item<3-> We want to position our tool as a central quality control utility for optimization and Machine Learning applications%
\item<4-> We will improve the tool and add features based on feedback%
\end{itemize}%

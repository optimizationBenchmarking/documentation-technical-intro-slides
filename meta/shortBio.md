# Dr. [Thomas Weise](http://www.it-weise.de): Short Bio

Dr. [Thomas Weise](http://www.it-weise.de) received a Diplom-Informatiker from [Chemnitz University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemnitz_University_of_Technology), Germany in 2005 and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [University of Kassel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Kassel), Germany in 2009. In the same year, he joined the [University of Science and Technology in China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Science_and_Technology_of_China) (USTC) as a PostDoc. He is now member of the [USTC-Birmingham Joint Research Institute in Intelligent Computation and Its Applications](http://ubri.ustc.edu.cn/) (UBRI). Since 2011, he is Associate Professor at the same group.

Dr. Weise has made contributions to the fields of optimization, logistic planning, and evolutionary computation. He has authored or co-authored more than 80 publications in international journals and conferences. He is the author of the book [Global Optimization Algorithms â€“ Theory and Application](http://www.it-weise.de/projects/book.pdf), which has been cited more than 600 times according to [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&citation_for_view=rT9StgcAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C). He is also the developer of the open source software [optimizationBenchmarking](http://optimizationbenchmarking.github.io). This software supports researchers in the fields of optimization and machine learning by mining performance information from large data sets or log files gathered from their experiments. The predecessor of this system, the [TSP Suite](https://github.com/optimizationBenchmarking/tspSuite), was also developed by him.
